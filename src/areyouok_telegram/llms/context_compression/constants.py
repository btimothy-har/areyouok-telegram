LIFE_SITUATION_DESC = """
The person's immediate life circumstances and ongoing challenges that form the backdrop of their need for support. \
This encompasses their current stressors, whether from work, relationships, health, finances, or major life \
transitions.

Document recent triggering events or changes that prompted them to seek connection, along with their overall emotional \
climate - are they feeling overwhelmed, stuck, hopeful, or exhausted? Understanding their day-to-day reality helps \
ensure support remains grounded in their actual experience rather than abstract concepts.
"""

CONNECTION_DESC = """
The unique relational dynamic that has evolved between the person and their support system. This captures their \
preferred mode of engagement - some people need to verbally process without interruption, others seek \
collaborative problem-solving, while some simply need witnessing and validation. Document which conversational \
approaches land well with them and which fall flat. Note moments of genuine connection, shared understanding, or \
even humor that define the relationship's character. This ensures continuity in tone and approach that honors \
the established relationship.
"""

PERSONAL_CONTEXT_DESC = """
The person's deeper identity markers, life philosophy, and historical experiences that shape their worldview. \
This includes their stated values, cultural or spiritual frameworks, and the life experiences they reference \
when making sense of current challenges. Capture their self-identified strengths and the internal or external \
resources they draw upon. Understanding these foundational elements ensures support aligns with who they are \
rather than imposing external frameworks that may not resonate.
"""

CONVERSATION_DESC = """
The narrative thread and momentum of ongoing dialogue. This tracks where the session concluded, which \
topics remain open for exploration, and questions that await answers. Document any insights they've articulated \
or commitments they've made to themselves. Note their conversational preferences - do they need time to sit \
with ideas, or do they prefer rapid exploration? This continuity should prevent repetitive cycles and honor the \
progressive nature of their journey.
"""

PRACTICAL_MATTERS_DESC = """
The concrete, actionable elements of their situation requiring attention or decision-making. This includes \
specific dilemmas they're facing, time-sensitive decisions, and real-world constraints affecting their options. \
Document strategies or resources previously discussed and their response to these suggestions. Keep track of \
external factors like deadlines, appointments, or obligations that create structure around their support needs.
"""

FEEDBACK_DESC = """
The person's explicit and implicit communication about the support relationship itself, including the subtle \
patterns that reveal their needs. This captures their direct feedback about what helps or hinders, but also \
the unspoken elements - their processing style, their rhythm of engagement, and the specific qualities that \
help them feel truly heard versus superficially acknowledged. Document patterns in their help-seeking, \
their comfort with different depths of exploration, and preserve their exact language for breakthrough moments. \
This meta-awareness ensures the support relationship remains responsive and authentic to their evolving needs.
